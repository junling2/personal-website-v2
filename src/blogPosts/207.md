### Problem Description

There are a total of *numCourses* courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to *numCourses - 1*. You are given an array *prerequisites* where prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>] indicates that you must take course b<sub>i</sub> first if you want to take course a<sub>i</sub>.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

If a course does not appear in the *prerequisites* array, it has no prerequisites.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

#### Example 1:

> **Input**: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]] <br> **Output**: true <br> **Explanation**: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and course 0 can be taken with no prereqs. So it is possible.

#### Example 2:

> **Input**: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]] <br> **Output**: false <br> **Explanation**: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= numCourses <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

### Solution

This problem is equivalent to detecting a cycle in the directed graph represented by *prerequisites*. If there is no cycle, then all the courses can be completed and return true, else return false. Depth First Search would be a straight forward approach where we recursively check all neighbours of a node and keep a visited set of nodes to detect any cycles occurring. 

First, we can convert *prerequisites* into an adjacency list in the form of a HashMap where we map each course to its list of prerequisites. This will make it easier to recurse through the prereqs of each course. 

We can then create a DFS method that takes in the course number and returns a boolean for if the course can be completed or not. There are 2 base cases for this method. If a course is not in the adjacency list, it has no prereqs, so return true. If a course number already exists in the visited set, then a cycle is present, so return false.

Otherwise, it is a course that has not been visited and has prereqs. So add it to the visited set, and iterate through its prereqs to see if any return false. If all the prereqs of a course return true, it can be completed and no cycles will result from this course, so remove it from the visited set and the adjacency list so no repeated recursions occur.

Finally, we can iterate through all the course numbers from 0 to *numCourses - 1* and pass it to the DFS method. Return true if all courses return true. We have to check every single course because there is a case where there are no prerequisites and each course is a disconnected node in the graph, then we have to check that every node is not present in the adjacency list. 

#### Java Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adj = new HashMap();
    Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet();
    
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prereqs) {
        // fill adj list with prereqs for each node
        for (int[] i : prereqs) {
            List<Integer> ls = adj.computeIfAbsent(i[0], v -> new ArrayList<Integer>());
            ls.add(i[1]);
        }
        // iterate through each course
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (!dfs(i)) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    public boolean dfs(int crs) {
        if (visited.contains(crs)) return false; // cycle
        if (!adj.containsKey(crs)) return true; // no prereqs
        
        // else, add to visited and dfs for prereqs
        visited.add(crs);
        for (int prereq : adj.get(crs)) {
            if(!dfs(prereq)) return false;
        }
        // all dependencies resolved, not possible to loop back to any node, remove from visited set and adj map 
        visited.remove(crs);
        adj.remove(crs);
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Create adj list
        adjList = { i:[] for i in range(numCourses)}
        for course, pre in prerequisites:
            adjList[course].append(pre)

        visited = set()
        
        def dfs(course):
            if course in visited:
                return False
            if adjList[course] == []:
                return True
            
            visited.add(course);            
            for pre in adjList[course]:
                if not dfs(pre): return False
       
            visited.remove(course)
            adjList[course] = []
            
            return True
        
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i): return False
        return True
```

#### Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**

Where V is the number of vertices in the graph which is *numCourses* and E is the number of edges in the graph, which is length of *prerequisites*. DFS will traverse all nodes and edges of the graph.

#### Space Complexity: **O(V)**

Space taken by the visited set and adj list
